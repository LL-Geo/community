# Community resources for the Fatiando a Terra project

This repository contains resources for the Fatiando community: rules and
guidelines, meeting notes, a place to organize project wide maintenance, etc.

## Calls and meeting notes

| Info | |
|:--|:---|
| ðŸ“± **Join a call** | https://jitsi.softwareunderground.org/FatiandoATerraMeetings |
| ðŸ“… **Shared calendar** | http://calendar.fatiando.org |

All our meetings are **open to everyone**!

**Development Calls:** We meet up **weekly** to discuss routine project
development: implementation details, code refactoring, maintenance tasks,
documentation, etc. Discussions tend to be **more technical** than our
Community Calls.
They are a great way to learn more about day-to-day development and the
internal workings of our code.
It's absolutely fine to join and just listen to what we discuss
but we welcome participation!

ðŸ“œ The live **meeting notes** can be read and edited by anyone on HackMD
(archived in the `development-calls` folder of this repository):

* 2021: https://hackmd.io/@fatiando/development-calls-2021

**Community Calls:** are open to everyone!
Join us if you're interested in the project,
want to find out more,
or just want to chat with fellow coding geoscientists.
We'll **post on Slack** when we hold these.

## Code of Conduct

## Guides

:tada: First of all, thank you for considering getting involved in our project!
**Any help/feedback you can provide is greatly appreciated.**

These guides layout the standard processes for contributing to the project,
performing maintenance, establishing authorship, and more:

* [Contributing Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md): how to get started working on the
  project.
* [Authorship Guidelines](AUTHORSHIP.md): how we attribute authorship in
  archives and publications
* [Maintainers Guide](MAINTENANCE.md): procedures for maintenance tasks like
  handling pull requests, making releases, etc.

Please feel free to use these files for your own projects.
