# Fatiando Development Calls 2022

ðŸ“± **Join the video call:** https://swu.ng/chateau (Gather Town)

> **IMPORTANT**: Everyone is required to follow our 
> [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/fatiando/community/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
> when participating in the Fatiando community. Please review it carefully.

Development calls are **open to everyone**! Here we discuss routine project development: implementation details, code refactoring, maintenance tasks, documentation, etc. Discussions tend to be **more technical** than our Community Calls.

**Everyone is encouraged to edit the notes below.**

## 2022-02-11

**Time:** 14:00 (UTC)

**Participants** 

- Lu
- Mariana
- Leo
- Santi

**Discussion points:**

- Replaced Google Analytics with Plausible throughout the project
    - Now we have a more privacy-friendly analytics service.
    - You can see the stats here: https://plausible.io/fatiando.org
    - We also have plausible on the legacy website: https://plausible.io/legacy.fatiando.org
- The embedded Youtube videos in our website also have trackers, so we decided to remove it with thumbnails (plus some CSS hacks to make it look like YT interface): https://www.fatiando.org/learn/
- Leo has raised the idea to SWUNG of using Plausible for all the projects.
    - The board is looking at it very positively :tada:
- Pooch got a new release: 1.6.0! :rocket: :clinking_glasses: 
- Installation instructions for the old `fatiando` package: https://www.fatiando.org/install/#Installing-the-legacy-fatiando-package
    - No numpy v1.10 for windows, only >= 1.14 is available in conda-forge
    - Numpy 1.9 is available: https://anaconda.org/anaconda/numpy/files?version=1.9.3
    - If you want to try it out, try it with `mamba` instead of `conda` (it's much faster): https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html
    - Maybe not worth the effort really. 
    - Could just tell people to copy the bit of the code that they need and see if it works in Python 3.
    - Follow up on Slack to see what they want out of Fatiando. If it doesn't involve compiled code, it may be easier to copy the source files.
- Santi wants to work on a `TesseroidLayer` after the PhD defense is done
- Also transform the gallery examples into actual tutorials for Harmonica
- Prioritize the FFT stuff that Lu started developing
- Add forward modelling of tensor components
- IDEA: pair programming hours!
    - Boosts productivity
    - Good learning experience
    - Might be good to try this out before Transform (last week of April)

**Time:** 14:00 (UTC)

**Participants** 

* Leo
* Lu

**Discussion points:**

* Migration of datasets to https://github.com/fatiando-data is complete!
    * Now need to update Ensaio to match
* Pooch 1.6.0: https://github.com/fatiando/pooch/issues/283
    * Will make a new release as soon as I get some time
    * Drop Python 3.6 after this release
* Migrating analytics to Plausible:
    * Website, Harmonica, and legacy docs all converted
    * Santi wrote a script: https://github.com/fatiando/community/issues/46
    * Any help running this in other repositories is appreciated
    * Not a moment too soon: https://tutanota.com/blog/posts/google-analytics/ (ht Santi)
* Lu implemented some filters in Harmonica:
    * PR: https://github.com/fatiando/harmonica/pull/299
    * Try writing a test for the upward continuation first

## 2022-01-14

**Time:** 14:00 (UTC)

**Participants** 

* Leo
* Santi

**Discussion points:**

* Happy new year! :confetti_ball: :fireworks: 
* Move the meeting to Gather Town
* Restructure how we forward some URLs (thanks Lu for catching the slack link error): https://github.com/fatiando/website/pull/46
    * Contact links need to be updated in some projects still
    * See https://github.com/fatiando/community/issues/43
    * **Good novice issue** to tackle
* Trying out Plausible analytics on our main website
    * The statistics are public and anonymous for anyone who wishes to see them: https://plausible.io/fatiando.org
    * Trial for 30 days starting 22 Dec 2021
    * Leo will pay for now (we only need the cheapest tier)
    * **Shall we keep this?**
        * Decision: Keep Plausible! 
    * We can petition Software Underground to take up costs. It's easy to transfer our account to them and they can add us as admins. Could be used by other projects and the Swung websites as well.
        * Leo will write on the Slack explaining what we did and asking their opinion
    * If we like it, we can switch all our docs to this:
        * Update the code in the `doc` source template for all repositories
        * Make a script/macro to replace the google analytics code in the rendered HTML in all `gh-pages` branches (so we can monitor visits to older pages)
        * Have to replace [this code](https://github.com/fatiando/website/blob/6bf54d6172ecebc33f28ee2da681dc80ab36b28d/_templates/layout.html#L43) with [this code](https://github.com/fatiando/website/blob/6bf54d6172ecebc33f28ee2da681dc80ab36b28d/_templates/layout.html#L56)
        * **Anyone interested in giving this a try?**
    * Download and backup the data form Google Analytics. Maybe in the `community` repo. Could be a yearly thing.
        * Need to clean the country names. Take a look at the code that Santi wrote for his thesis (https://github.com/santisoler/phd-thesis/tree/main/analytics)
        * Make maybe a nice dashboard for this to display the data.
* Ensaio got a first release :tada: https://www.fatiando.org/ensaio/v0.1.0
    * Test it out with another package. Doesn't have to be a complete switch, just 1 example at a time. Verde or Harmonica are good candidates because they have more examples.
    * **Any takers?**
    * After discussion, the `ensaio.v1` imports are kind of strange and would require duplication of a lot of information once a new data major release is done. A better approach would be to package and release each dataset individually:
        * Ditch `v*` modules
        * Each `fetch_*` function will have a required `version` argument (can't be optional to avoid new releases breaking old docs)
        * Available versions should be listed in the docstrings.
        * Add a `source` (?) argument to choose whether to download the data from `"doi"` or `"github"`. Default to `"doi"`.
        * Use an env variable to change source of download, maybe `ENSAIO_DOWNLOAD_GITHUB` or something. This takes precedence over the `source` argument.
        * Each dataset needs to be moved to a different reporitory with an associated GitHub release and Zenodo DOI.
            * Should this be `data-*` repos on github.com/fatiando or do we make a new org just for that (github.com/fatiando-data)?
* New tool to help testing on CI: https://github.com/fatiando/dependente
    * Used in Pooch: https://github.com/fatiando/pooch/pull/289
* Verde got some maintenance love :heart: :
    * Refactored the CI to make it faster: https://github.com/fatiando/verde/pull/336
    * Replace pylint: https://github.com/fatiando/verde/pull/337
    * Link to `fatiando/community` in the guides: https://github.com/fatiando/verde/pull/338
* Move away from `setup.py`:
    * See https://github.com/fatiando/pooch/pull/280
