Development calls are **open to everyone**! Here we discuss routine project development: implementation details, code refactoring, maintenance tasks, documentation, etc. Discussions tend to be **more technical** than our Community Calls.

**Everyone is encouraged to edit the notes below.**

## 2022-01-14

**Time:** 14:00 (UTC)

**Participants** 

* Leo
* Santi

**Discussion points:**

* Happy new year! :confetti_ball: :fireworks: 
* Move the meeting to Gather Town
* Restructure how we forward some URLs (thanks Lu for catching the slack link error): https://github.com/fatiando/website/pull/46
    * Contact links need to be updated in some projects still
    * See https://github.com/fatiando/community/issues/43
    * **Good novice issue** to tackle
* Trying out Plausible analytics on our main website
    * The statistics are public and anonymous for anyone who wishes to see them: https://plausible.io/fatiando.org
    * Trial for 30 days starting 22 Dec 2021
    * Leo will pay for now (we only need the cheapest tier)
    * **Shall we keep this?**
        * Decision: Keep Plausible! 
    * We can petition Software Underground to take up costs. It's easy to transfer our account to them and they can add us as admins. Could be used by other projects and the Swung websites as well.
        * Leo will write on the Slack explaining what we did and asking their opinion
    * If we like it, we can switch all our docs to this:
        * Update the code in the `doc` source template for all repositories
        * Make a script/macro to replace the google analytics code in the rendered HTML in all `gh-pages` branches (so we can monitor visits to older pages)
        * Have to replace [this code](https://github.com/fatiando/website/blob/6bf54d6172ecebc33f28ee2da681dc80ab36b28d/_templates/layout.html#L43) with [this code](https://github.com/fatiando/website/blob/6bf54d6172ecebc33f28ee2da681dc80ab36b28d/_templates/layout.html#L56)
        * **Anyone interested in giving this a try?**
    * Download and backup the data form Google Analytics. Maybe in the `community` repo. Could be a yearly thing.
        * Need to clean the country names. Take a look at the code that Santi wrote for his thesis (https://github.com/santisoler/phd-thesis/tree/main/analytics)
        * Make maybe a nice dashboard for this to display the data.
* Ensaio got a first release :tada: https://www.fatiando.org/ensaio/v0.1.0
    * Test it out with another package. Doesn't have to be a complete switch, just 1 example at a time. Verde or Harmonica are good candidates because they have more examples.
    * **Any takers?**
    * After discussion, the `ensaio.v1` imports are kind of strange and would require duplication of a lot of information once a new data major release is done. A better approach would be to package and release each dataset individually:
        * Ditch `v*` modules
        * Each `fetch_*` function will have a required `version` argument (can't be optional to avoid new releases breaking old docs)
        * Available versions should be listed in the docstrings.
        * Add a `source` (?) argument to choose whether to download the data from `"doi"` or `"github"`. Default to `"doi"`.
        * Use an env variable to change source of download, maybe `ENSAIO_DOWNLOAD_GITHUB` or something. This takes precedence over the `source` argument.
        * Each dataset needs to be moved to a different reporitory with an associated GitHub release and Zenodo DOI.
            * Should this be `data-*` repos on github.com/fatiando or do we make a new org just for that (github.com/fatiando-data)?
* New tool to help testing on CI: https://github.com/fatiando/dependente
    * Used in Pooch: https://github.com/fatiando/pooch/pull/289
* Verde got some maintenance love :heart: :
    * Refactored the CI to make it faster: https://github.com/fatiando/verde/pull/336
    * Replace pylint: https://github.com/fatiando/verde/pull/337
    * Link to `fatiando/community` in the guides: https://github.com/fatiando/verde/pull/338
* Move away from `setup.py`:
    * See https://github.com/fatiando/pooch/pull/280
